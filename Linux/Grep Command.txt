Search and show lines within the context - 1 of 2: preview Before and After first

    💲 grep -win -C 5 "John Williams" names.txt
    
    ⚡ C: Context
    
    😎 we should apply this -C: with enough space to preview the context (E.g. 5 lines Before and After)
    
    



Search and show lines within the context - 2 of 2: locate the exact place

    💲 grep -win -B 4 "John Williams" names.txt
    
    ⚡ B: Before
    
    💲 grep -win -A 4 "John Williams" names.txt

Search for text in MULTIPLE files at once:

    💲 grep -win "John Williams" *.txt
    
    👀 make sure to define extension with *wildcard fore text files ONLY
    
    

Search for text in ALL files in ALL subdirectories in your project:

    💲 grep -winr "John Williams" * 👍
    
    💲 grep -winr "John Williams" .
    
    💲 grep -winr "John Williams" ./
    
    
    

Search for what file(s) contain the match:

    💲 grep -winrl "John Williams" *
    
    💲 grep -wirl "John Williams" *
    
    👀 we could remove the letter n (for Line No.) since we are ONLY searching for files. NOT context within file.
    
    
    

Search for what file(s) contain the match and count how many matches (hits) 🎯:

    💲 grep -winrc "John Williams" *
    
    💲 grep -wirc "John Williams" *
    
    👀 we could remove the letter n (for Line No.) since we are ONLY searching for files. NOT context within file.
    
    ⚡ c: count - how many matches (hits) 🎯
    
    



Display ALL search history:

Filter ✂ command history with pipe | :

    💲 history | grep "git commit"
    
    💲 history | grep "git commit" | grep "dotfile"
    
    😎 we could use multiple pipe | to add to the filter ✂
    
    


Search file with Regular Expression:

    💲 grep -r "…-…-…." *
    
    👀 …-…-…. : represents standard phone book format with regular expression
    
    3 characters -dash 3 characters -dash 4 characters
    
    😎 -r: recursive will always ensure to include ALL subdirectories 
    
    👍 Always best practices to add -r when you are not familiar with the Project contents
    
    

    



Search file with Perl compatible Regular Expression:
    
    💲 grep -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" *
    
    👀 -P: Perl compatible Regular X
    
    ⚡ \d{} \d{} \d{}
    
    


🌟 Combine count hits & Regular Expression:

    💲 grep -winrc -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" *
    
    💲 grep -wirc -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" * 👍
    
    💲 grep -wirl -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" *
