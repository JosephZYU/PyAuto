Elevate to Root privilege and Edit bash_profile:

    💲 sudo nano .bash_profile
    
    (🔓 Enter Ubuntu password if needed)
    
    🤏 alias winhome='cd /mnt/c/Users/JosephYu/Desktop/'
    
    👀 the above path is for Ubuntu WSL2 ONLY
    
    
    
    
    😎 always prefer to edit .bash_profile (over .bashrc)
    
        ○ .bash_profile: edit, re-start the terminal and ready to GO! 👍
        ○ .bashrc: edit, and you still have to "source .bashrc" to activate every time before execution 👎
