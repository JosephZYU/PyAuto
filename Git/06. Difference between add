💲 git add -A    Add the ENTIRE working tree 🌳
💲 git add --all 
💲 git add (default)  - including . Current directory ✔
 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - including ../ parent directory ✔
💲 git add . Add the Current directory and ALL sub-directories
    
 - including . Current directory ✔
 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - excluding ../ parent directory ❌👀
    
     - 😎 ONLY works the SAME when you're on TOP directory
    
     - 👍 It's recommended to add . before commit  ALL (-A) to the Staging area
💲 git add -u    Add ONLY the updated / modified / deleted files in the ENTIRE working tree 🌳
💲 git add --update  
 - Excluding newly created files that has not yet committed
    
 - 👍 great for gradual "partial" project submission that we've just worked on

 - including . Current directory ✔
 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - including ../ parent directory ✔





Git Add the ENTIRE working tree 🌳
    
    💲 git add -A
    
         - including . Current directory ✔
 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - including ../ parent directory ✔
    
    🧐 -A add the ENTIRE working tree including the "sub-branch" of the tree 🌳
    

    

    
    💲 git add -A
    
    🧐 Even if we apply the -A in the sub-directory - it will ALSO include all the parent tree
    

    

    
    💲 git add -A sub_dir/
    
    🧐 We may also specify the "specific" directory to add to the staging area
    
    

    
    💲 git add sub_dir/
    
    😎In fact, git add -A is the default method here, we can simply type add ${folder name} without the -A 👍 
    

    
    
    
Git add ONLY Current and any Sub-directories - Excluding newly created files that has not yet committed

    💲 git add .

         - including . Current directory ✔
 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - excluding ../ parent directory ❌👀
        
         - 😎 ONLY works the SAME when you're on TOP directory
         - 👍 It's recommended to add . before commit  ALL (-A) to the Staging area
    




Git add ONLY the updated / modified / deleted files - Excluding newly created files that has not yet committed

    💲 git add -u
    
    💲 git add --update
    
         - Excluding newly created files that has not yet committed
        
 - 👍great for gradual "partial" project submission that we've just worked on

 - including /* sub directory ✔
 - including ../ parent directory ✔

    

    
    
    💲 git add -u sub_dir/
    
    🧐 Similar to add -A, we may also specify the "specific" directory to add to the staging area
    
    💲 git add -u .
    
    😎 ALT: adding the dot " . " in the end to specify the ONLY current directory.
