Recall from 2 of 5 - Get rid of ALL untracked files 👍👍:

    💲 git clean -df
    
    👀 This operation ONLY clean Untracked files, it does NOT revert changes performed on your - the modification is still there
    
    
    
    
If we want to see what our file look like before we "working on" it:

    💲 git stash save "Worked on add function"
    
    NOTE: if we stash it, all changes will disappear
    
    
    
    # List all the stashes created with ID No.
    
    💲 git stash list
    
    
    
    # Retrieve stash back by ID No.
    
    💲 git stash apply stash@{0}
    
    😎 stash@{No.} from the stash list 🤏
    
    
    
    # Switch back from [ ! $ ] Stash to [ $ ]Feature branch (Reset us back to where we were)
    
    💲 git checkout -- .
    
    
    
    # Use "pop" to grab the 1st stash we have, apply those changes, and drop the stash
    
    💲 git stash pop
    
    👀 Even though we dropped the stash, the changes are still there
    
    
    
Save up-to-date changes into Stash:

    🎯 Stash is to meant to SAVE changes into functions as your "Inventory" (before submission to the remote Git)
    
    💲 git stash save "Add Calc.py functions"
    
    💲 git stash list - Optional - check it has been saved ✅
    
    😎 NOTE: once we saved out stash, we will automatically switch back to the [ $ ] Feature Branch and back to where we started
    
     - From [ ! ] back to [ $ ] will drop changes since we saved it into stash@{0}
    
    
    
    💲 git stash save "Added Square function"
    
    💲 git stash list
    
    💲 git stash pop
    
    
    
    
Get rid of the Square function (drop):

    💲 git stash drop
    
    👀 It will undo the square function, and drop the stash@{0} - Added Square function
    
    
    
Get rid of ALL of our stashes created:
    
    🛑 Apply with Caution - it will delete all stashes we have 

    💲 git stash clear
    
    😎 It's ALL gone
